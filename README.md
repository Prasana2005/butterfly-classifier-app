Butterfly Species Classifier 🦋
------------------------------

This is a Streamlit web app for classifying butterfly species using a deep learning model trained with transfer learning.

🔍 Project Description:
- Classifies 75 species of butterflies using a CNN model (MobileNetV2) trained on 6,499 images.
- Achieves 90% validation accuracy.
- Uses transfer learning to reduce training time and improve accuracy.
- Built with TensorFlow and deployed using Streamlit.

📁 Files Included:
- app.py               : Streamlit app code
- butterfly_model.h5   : Pre-trained Keras model file
- requirements.txt     : Python dependencies for Streamlit Cloud deployment

🚀 How to Run (Locally):
1. Install Streamlit and dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
